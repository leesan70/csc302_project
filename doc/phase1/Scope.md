# Scope
Int his document we discuss our learning goals, and as a result where we will focus our attention and anything areas we may omit.

### Anujan
My primary learning goal for this project is to learn more about CICD piplines and implement it with testing. As well as learning to implement multiple testing types from Unit test to integration and front end to support the CICD pipeline to allow continuous and autonomous deployments.

## Jacob
My learning goal is to gain more knowledge and experience in APIs design, and backend development in particular using node.js, express and mongodb to build RESTful APIs. I will therefore be focusing on the backend, database and APIs testing.

## James
My learning goal is to design and implement a formal specification for a model/api and gain experience with OpenAPI, mongoDB and mocha. My focus will be backend documentation, database implementation/integration, and testing.

## Johnny
Learning goal is to implement design patterns suited for each framework and libraries(Express, React etc..) and maintain a good code base. Also make good use of Docker for testing, building and deploying the application. 

## Kevin
I have previous experience in React through ReactNative development. I wish to use React in the Web and want to learn Redux, which is a very popular state management library in use with React. Learning component testing Enzyme and Jest is also one of my goals.

## Lina
Primary goal: front end technologies; learning react/redux, and testing in the front end 
Secondary goal: learning CI

## Ryan
I would like to improve my frontend development skills, including modern JavaScript and ES6, React, Redux, Material UI, and front-end testing strategies.
